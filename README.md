# tuitimer

I noticed there weren't too many timers that were built into a tui, so i'm trying to... undo that? whatever

## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a simple intuative timer in a terminal.

## Progress

Currently it doesn't do anything, but it draws a few things, so really we're halfway there.
There's just some basic infrastructure for the actual timer.

## Contributing

If for some unholy reason you wish to contribute, fork the repo, and in your pull request just label what you did, and what changes you did to it.
